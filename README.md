## Acceptance Criteria


To create a weather dashboard with form inputs where user can search for a city and is then presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. Then when user wants to view current weather conditions for that city, they presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. Then when they view the UV index, they presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. Next when they view future weather conditions for that city, they presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. Then when they click on a city in the search history then they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
